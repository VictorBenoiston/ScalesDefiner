# Scales
 A script that allow you to input the notes and it'll output the kind of scale.

A scale in music theory is a group of notes in sequence.

There are a lot of scales, and everyone can make your own scale, as far as it sounds god, or not, haha! But that's the cool thing about music, you have the rules.

In this script we have the most common cases of scale, which are:
    -Major scale;
    -Minor scale;
    -Minor harmonic;
    -Minor melodic.

Basically, what you have to do after run is: 
type each note (8 notes) in the sequence, with # and b as well.
Then, it you return the kind of scale you just typed.
